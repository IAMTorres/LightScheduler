sentence=Schedule LED on/off times with gradual sunset dimming and EEPROM persistence.
paragraph=A non-blocking Arduino library that turns a PWM-controlled light on and off at configurable times. At the configured off time, it begins a smooth gradual dimming (simulating a natural sunset) over a configurable duration. Schedule survives power cuts via EEPROM. Works with any RTC module.
